The clinic will start in mid October when new law students have settled into their **3L** or **ML** courses. There will be nine seats available, 3 for each house focus-group. (**future hosts/instructors, OS-admins, and code-wardens**). 

The clinic will run until the second third week in January 2023.
    
*The clinic is also available to non-legal experienced-based LexDAO members, but they will not participate in the later Lessons (TBD 10+) focused on the law in practice. (some self-guided resources will be available for some of the basics on law school taught topics). The subject matters are too broad for an **automation clinic**)*


1. Introductions:

3. Everyone in LexDAO should have an access token for voting. *See [Access Token]((https://opensea.io/assets/matic/0xa77e11b845e31e2c24ddc004fb8f93759c097274/496925736968920592695302422083945832576479845996267831971701744113549326)) and [Membership Token]((https://opensea.io/assets/matic/0x9378f978c691f0247dd75f5efa4c77efb31b26c6/41)) and [Legal Engineering Token]((https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x7106bb3faaa84fff35ed57405d24d47dea6df183/6))* 
4. Steps to apply and actions to join:
	1. Attend a live call and introduce yourself. â˜‘
	2. Create a Self.ID profile. https://self.id/
	3. Completely fill out the form at **https://clinic-signup.freeweb3.com/** 
	4. Later: For Reference only until we have a full group.  Vote for a group meeting time in Snapshot. See https://snapshot.org/#/smartlaw.eth and  https://snapshot.org/#/profile/0x130093A5aEbc07e78e16f0EcEF09d1c45AfD8178

	5. Join Web3Skills SmartLaw Discord for team workflow and reward after the form is filled out. 

If you are admitted in to the clinic you will have one of 3 roles; a **host/instructor, OS-adminstrator, or a code-warden/legal engineer**. 

*Note: We do not practice law. We develop tools for practitioners.*

#### During the clinic you will ...
1. Create a opensource free Linux based personal development server (**Ubuntu Studio** *ver.22.04.1*)
2. Learn about the significance of crytography in computing systems and how it applies to the future of law.
3. Create transaction and query information from public blockchains and node-based systems.
4. Learn specific tips and tools of digital assets and take a deep dive into the anatomy of Non-fungible tokens.
5. Explore a deep library of developer tools with Web3Skills scaffolding and token gated course content.
6. Explore the anatomy of a  NodeJS React application that serves the SmartLaw operating system.
7. Explore how decentralized finance is disrupting traditional financial markets with oracles.
8. Explore the metaverse and get a glimpse into the future of computing and the immersive user experience in 3-dimensional digital worlds. 



#### Tools we will use in the clinic.
* Smart-contracts written in the Solidity language
* Direct javascript calls to the blockchains
* API calls to and from databases
* Content storage like IPFS and ARWEAVE
* Node based application and components
* Access tokens and utility tokens
* Speculative tokens, DeFi and security laws


**REWARDS**: If you become part of the clinic and complete all the lesson you will be offered a selection of monetary, digital asset, and/or stake opportunity rewards.

    The Clinic Curriculum
    
	 - [ ] **Lesson 0** : Setup your automation/operating system (**Linux Ubuntu Studio: Version 22.04.1 LTS Jammy Jellyfish** [https://ubuntustudio.org/](https://ubuntustudio.org/ "https://ubuntustudio.org/")) . Guided installation. _**see prerequisites**_ [https://discord.com/channels/970451521332457472/1016472374918516857/1020425666254090350](https://discord.com/channels/970451521332457472/1016472374918516857/1020425666254090350 "https://discord.com/channels/970451521332457472/1016472374918516857/1020425666254090350")  
	 - [ ] **Lesson 1**: Run a local content storage node (**IPFS**). Guided installation. 
	 - [ ] **Lesson 2**: Access an endpoint of a public blockchain and query transactions (**Ethereum Mainnet**) using script files. Guided installation using **Infura**. 
	 - [ ] **Lesson 3**: Create a **SSH** public/private key pair and attach it to **Github**. Guided setup. 
	 - [ ] **Lesson 4**: Create a public/private keypair for **Web3** use. Guided setup by running the computation locally. 
	 - [ ] **Lesson 5**: Use a private key to create a **SmartLaw Access Token** and use it to gate content. 
	 - [ ] **Lesson #6**: Use a private key to create a non-transferable **SmartLaw Achievement Token** and distribute it to a user list. 
	 - [ ] **Lesson 7**: Encrypt a document an put in on a local **IPFS** node. 
	 - [ ] **Lesson 8**: Set up a Remote Procedure Call (**RPC**) in an account manager (**Metamask**) and memorialize the encrypted document on a public blockchain (**Polygon**). 
	 - [ ] **Lesson 9**: Passing role tokens (NFTs) for operations teams. I have some **Ethereans** we will pass among operators as examples. When the NFT passes, so does the operation role assigned to it.

2.  A liitle pre-clinic homework for those who want to be prepared. We will also go over it in the primer meeting, but once you have that ISO image on a bootable USB and a computer to recognize it, It's off to the races. Here are a few way to go about it. **Easiest way**:

 [https://linuxmint-installation-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/burn.html#:~:text=bootable%20USB%20stick-,In%20Linux%20Mint,USB%20device%20and%20click%20Write](https://linuxmint-installation-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/burn.html#:~:text=bootable%20USB%20stick-,In%20Linux%20Mint,USB%20device%20and%20click%20Write "https://linuxmint-installation-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/burn.html#:~:text=bootable%20USB%20stick-,In%20Linux%20Mint,USB%20device%20and%20click%20Write"). **Other methods:** [https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201372](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201372 "https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201372") .

When you have the USB ready. This is the way to get your computer to recognize it as the primary boot media and we will proceed with installation of the OS: [https://www.acronis.com/en-us/cyber-protection-center/posts/usb-boot/](https://www.acronis.com/en-us/cyber-protection-center/posts/usb-boot/ "https://www.acronis.com/en-us/cyber-protection-center/posts/usb-boot/") (edited)
