The clinic will start in mid October when new law students have settled into their **3L** or **ML** courses. There will be nine seats available, 3 for each house focus-group. (**future hosts/instructors, OS-admins, and code-wardens**). 

The clinic will run until the second third week in January 2023.
    
*The clinic is also available to non-legal experienced-based LexDAO members, but they will not participate in the later Lessons (TBD 10+) focused on the law in practice. (some self-guided resources will be available for some of the basics on law school taught topics). The subject matters are too broad for an **automation clinic**)*


1. Introductions: whoami? whoaru?

Guided installation. _**see prerequisites**_ [https://discord.com/channels/970451521332457472/1016472374918516857/1020425666254090350](https://discord.com/channels/970451521332457472/1016472374918516857/1020425666254090350 "https://discord.com/channels/970451521332457472/1016472374918516857/1020425666254090350")  
	 - [ ] **Lesson 1**: Run a local content storage node (**IPFS**). Guided installation. 
	 - [ ] **Lesson 2**: Access an endpoint of a public blockchain and query transactions (**Ethereum Mainnet**) using script files. Guided installation using **Infura**. 
	 - [ ] **Lesson 3**: Create a **SSH** public/private key pair and attach it to **Github**. Guided setup. 
	 - [ ] **Lesson 4**: Create a public/private keypair for **Web3** use. Guided setup by running the computation locally. 
	 - [ ] **Lesson 5**: Use a private key to create a **SmartLaw Access Token** and use it to gate content. **Lesson #6**: Use a private key to create a non-transferable **SmartLaw Achievement Token** and distribute it to a user list. 
	 - [ ] **Lesson 7**: Encrypt a document an put in on a local **IPFS** node.

2.  A liitle pre-clinic homework for those who want to be prepared. We will also go over it in the primer meeting, but once you have that ISO image on a bootable USB and a computer to recognize it, It's off to the races. Here are a few way to go about it. **Easiest way**:
[https://www.balena.io/etcher/](https://www.balena.io/etcher/)
 [https://linuxmint-installation-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/burn.html#:~:text=bootable%20USB%20stick-,In%20Linux%20Mint,USB%20device%20and%20click%20Write](https://linuxmint-installation-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/burn.html#:~:text=bootable%20USB%20stick-,In%20Linux%20Mint,USB%20device%20and%20click%20Write "https://linuxmint-installation-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/burn.html#:~:text=bootable%20USB%20stick-,In%20Linux%20Mint,USB%20device%20and%20click%20Write"). **Other methods:** [https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201372](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201372 "https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201372") .

When you have the USB ready. This is the way to get your computer to recognize it as the primary boot media and we will proceed with installation of the OS: [https://www.acronis.com/en-us/cyber-protection-center/posts/usb-boot/](https://www.acronis.com/en-us/cyber-protection-center/posts/usb-boot/ "https://www.acronis.com/en-us/cyber-protection-center/posts/usb-boot/") (edited)
